# Exam-Management-System-by-Anirudh

This project involves the development of a database system designed to manage student records, subjects, and online exams. The system is particularly useful for enabling students to take exams online by automatically providing them with an exam link.

The project is implemented using Python and MySQL. The database, named OnlineExam, consists of three primary tables: Student, Subject, and Exam. These represent the core entities of the system.

The system includes several Python modules and functions that integrate with MySQL to perform database operations. Using these functions, users can:

Add new records to any of the three tables.
Remove existing records.
Update details in the tables.
Retrieve specific records based on their primary keys.
